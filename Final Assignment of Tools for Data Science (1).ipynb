It serves as a foundation for many other libraries.\n\nPandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures like DataFrames to efficiently handle structured data, as well as functions for data cleaning, merging, reshaping, and more.\n\nMatplotlib: A comprehensive plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of plots, including line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and more.\n\nSeaborn: A higher-level visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, providing a more aesthetically pleasing and simplified interface for creating statistical graphics. It is particularly useful for visualizing relationships and patterns in data.\n\nscikit-learn: A popular machine learning library that offers a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, as well as tools for model evaluation, preprocessing, feature selection, and more.\n\nTensorFlow: A powerful open-source library for numerical computation and machine learning, with a particular focus on deep learning. It allows the creation and training of complex neural networks.\n\nPyTorch: Another widely used open-source library for deep learning and numerical computation. It provides a dynamic computation graph and is known for its flexibility and ease of use.\n\nKeras: A high-level deep learning library that acts as an interface to other deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Theano. It simplifies the process of building and training neural networks.\n\nSciPy: A library that builds on top of NumPy and provides additional numerical algorithms and tools for scientific computing. It includes modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, signal processing, and more.\n\nStatsmodels: A library focused on statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and statistical exploration of data. It offers a wide range of statistical models and methods for regression, time series analysis, survival analysis, and more.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many libraries available for data science in Python. The choice of libraries will depend on the specific tasks and requirements of your data science projects. ",
